This is the Starlink::Config module.
It is used by other modules to determine the location of the
Starlink system.

To install:

  % perl Makefile.PL
  % make
  % make test
  % make install

On a Starlink system perl is located in /star/Perl/bin. The
configuration file is automatically built during the initial
phase. The Starlink environment is determined by looking at
environment variables.

The location of the starlink system is determined by first looking for
$STARCONF_DEFAULT_STARLINK, then $STARLINK, then
$STARCONF_DEFAULT_PREFIX and finally $INSTALL else failling back to
'/star' (if found) and then '/stardev'. An error is raised if the
Starlink base directory determined in this manner does not actually
exist.

   % perldoc Starlink::Config
